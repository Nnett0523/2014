<h3>Courses</h3>

<h4>Quizz types [MOVED]</h4>
<ol>
  <li>One answer out of several (radios)</li>
  <li>Zero or more true statements, out of set (checkboxes)</li>
  <li>Match enumerated answers with their corresponding questions with DnD or
    selecting the question and then clicking the answer. </li>
  <li>Enter a (rather) exact text (possibly more then one), with some
    elasticity 
    <ol>
      <li>with or without quotes</li>
      <li>normalize blank space</li>
      <li>case-insensitive (optional)</li>
      <li>strip accents </li>
    </ol>
    <p>This can be achieved by massaging the text and/or providing a set of
    valid answers.</p>
    <p><img alt="quizzTextAnswers" src="quizzTextAnswers.png" width="647"
    height="436"></p>
    <p>It should be possible to set a "never mind" answer for a particular
    question that accepts any answer. </p>
    <p>Also, consider symbolic answers, like values from system variables or
    collected from previous quizzes.</p>
    <p>Allow for checking if the values are numeric and doing some calculations
    on then in order to check the correctness. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Allow entering some JavaScript or Java code and to run it, somehow
    sandboxed, and use the output as the result to be checked, maybe the
    console log, or the content of a specific variable. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Progress</h3>

<p>This 3-days week was an insights week. </p>

<h4>Exams</h4>

<p>Firstly, I realized that we need good exams better than courses. For the
Globant's purpose it doesn't matter what the globers do but what do they know.
</p>

<p>Moreover, we'd like to assess the globers knowledge in an unbiased way,
independent of the varying levels of self-esteem. </p>

<h4>Tracks</h4>

<p>As an initial approach, a <em>learning track</em> on a subject is a tree of
exams (minicerts) where the glober starts at the root and has to move to the
branches and the leaves. </p>

<p>The globers advance by approving exams. We don't care that much about how
they acquired the knowledge; we yes care about having good exams allowing us to
assert the globers level. </p>

<p>Actually, a glober that knows it all can blaze the trail from start to end
in a few hours just by approving all its exams. </p>

<p>So a track is its exams, and for each one a set of suggestions on how to get
the knowledge needed to approve it. </p>

<p>The exams are organized hierarchically: to be able to take a test the
globers must have approved al its <em>dependencies</em>. </p>

<h4>Course materials</h4>

<p>The exams approach doesn't mean that we won't develop any courses. It means
that for each leap we'll do some scouting in order to find appropriate
trainings, and if there are not then we'll have to make our own course. </p>

<p>As much as we can, we'll cater from the public courses offering from first
class universities. </p>

<h4>Additional knowledge</h4>

<p>For example, the course "M101J: MongoDB for Java Developers" is starting by
Mar 17, 2014. By March 27 there will be a course for node.js developers and
another for DBAs. These are 5 hours per week courses that span about 8 weeks.
</p>

<p>Amazon is offering their "AWS Partner Webinars". </p>

<p>Depending on what we expect to be requested by our clients we could be
building knowledge since today, allowing the globers to take the lengthy
courses like Mongo's as a part-time additional activity, that can be used to
neasure the glober's curiosity and interest. </p>

<h4>Exams creation</h4>

<p>We should have a means to create good online exams and to allow the globers
to take them and know the result immediately. </p>
