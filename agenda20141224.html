<p>IRM Overview</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Corporate Investment Bank's IRM team enables technologists to:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Manage their risk and control as a part of their day-to-day job, every
day</p>

<p>Make business decisions aligned to objectives and consideration of the
likelihood and impact of a realized threat</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>Our IRM agenda is based on JPMC IT Policy and Standards that are governed
via the Firm's IT Risk Leadership (ITRL) forum. Policies and standards are
developed with consideration of relevant regulations for example, SOX, GLBA,
and the expectations of our auditors and examiners.</p>

<p></p>

<p>We recommend that you review the JPMC IT Policy and Standards. You can do
this by clicking the "JPMC policies and standards" resource at the bottom of
the screen. This resource will be available at all times throughout this course
should you wish to consult it.</p>

<p>Technology Developed Tactical Applications</p>

<p></p>

<p>TDTA is an 'enterprise application' if it performs one or more of the
following functions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Stores the prime record for financial transactions and their respective
    valuation, for example, SOX</li>
  <li>Serves as the final source for regulatory reporting</li>
  <li>Produces financial statements including P &amp; L, risk positions, and so
    on</li>
  <li>Produces reports which have a client impact including client
  valuation</li>
  <li>Supports and/or performs a key business SOX control</li>
</ol>

<p></p>

<p>TDTAs are required to be treated the same as any other applications
including having a SEAL entry (central application repository) and are required
to comply with the relevant IT policies and standards.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Control Objectives:</p>
<ol>
  <li>ASA Processes and four key components of ASA</li>
  <li>Application ranking process and frequency of assessments based on
  ranking</li>
  <li>SOX applications and TDTA</li>
</ol>

<p>Data Integrity</p>

<p></p>

<p>For the past month, Simon has been receiving a new data feed from "iTrade",
a trading application. The AD team of "iTrade" reconciles information before
sending it to Simon. Simon updated the application interface diagram with this
new feed detail, as this was one of the control points introduced into the
project after Internal Audit raised an issue last year.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Simon wonders if any other checks and balances are required at his end.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Priya informs Simon that the application interface design must include
mechanisms to ensure that valid data has been received to prevent inaccurate,
invalid, or duplicate data being processed. This is mandated to ensure bad data
is stopped immediately from being processed further. Some examples of such
checks are:</p>

<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>Value range check</li>
  <li>Record count check</li>
  <li>Sequence number check</li>
  <li>Duplicate record check</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>Simon decides to consult his business team to understand if any additional
checks may need to be performed.</p>

<p> </p>

<p></p>

<p>Why are Access Controls Required?</p>

<p></p>

<p>Access controls are required to protect information against:</p>

<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>Unauthorized use</li>
  <li>Disclosure</li>
  <li>Modification</li>
  <li>Damage</li>
  <li>Loss</li>
</ul>

<p>This is achieved by ensuring that access to systems, data, and programs is
restricted to only authorized users.</p>

<p>Access authorization protocols, processes, and procedures must be defined,
documented, established, implemented and maintained in accordance with JPMC
policy as well as other corporate policies, and with applicable laws and
regulations for every application build.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>What is Access Administration?</p>

<p>Let's look at Access Administration in more detail. Remember, this control
ensures the creation and deletion of ID's is implemented with proper approvals;
and transfers and off-boarding are managed appropriately.</p>

<p>The Access Administration control is intended to document and manage access
authorization protocols, processes, and procedures that are defined,
documented, established and implemented for any application.</p>

<p>These access management processes must be clearly defined and be in place to
ensure that access entitlements are properly approved and assigned,
commensurate with job responsibilities and support adequate segregation of
duties.</p>

<p>Access Admin covers: </p>
<ul>
  <li>segregation of duties</li>
  <li>user on-boarding</li>
  <li>transfer handling</li>
  <li>user off-boarding</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>User On-boarding</p>

<p>The user on-boarding control is a "Preventative" control that leverages
request for new systems access. By being preventative, it averts the risk of
someone getting unauthorized access to a system without a properly documented
and approved request.</p>

<p>The request for access ensures that the appropriate people approve it and
ensures that access is appropriate for job function and responsibility. New
system accounts should only be created by request on the recognized access
provisioning tools in the firm, currently IBID/iCERT and EURC.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>What is Privileged Access?</p>

<p>Let's look at Privileged access in more detail. Remember the Privileged
Access Control Activity ensures access to privileged system functions is
limited to approved individuals, and this is properly monitored and
controlled.</p>

<p>Now that Simon has information about how the user access will be granted, he
needs to consider the technology users' access in the production
environment.</p>

<p>IRM has provided Simon with a reference table to guide him in determining
the type of access a developer, L3, AD Manager, Operate, and so on, should have
to Production.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>What is Access Recertification?</p>

<p>Let's look at Access Recertification in more detail now. Remember the Access
Recertification Control Activity ensures access is validated regularly to
confirm that entitlements are appropriate.</p>

<p>Access Recertification is the "Detective" access control. It is used to
capture access that is viewed as inappropriate after the access has been
granted.</p>

<p>Recertification is a periodic revalidation user access in a particular
system at several levels, this could be by entitlement or role (covers multiple
entitlements).</p>

<p>The recertification process validates that access is still required for a
valid business purpose and requires direct manager approval at the user level
and information Owner approval at the system level.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>The Access Control Toolset</p>

<p></p>

<p>So far in this topic we looked at these Access Control activities:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Security Configurations</p>

<p>Access Administration</p>

<p>Privileged Access</p>

<p>Access Recertification</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>The Access Control Toolset comprises the following tools and systems. Some
are owned and operated outside of the Corporate Investment Bank. This toolset
helps to implement the control activities.</p>
