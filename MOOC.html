on MOOCs as of Nov 2012</a>: </p>

<div class="framed">

<blockquote>
  Of late, one of the hottest subjects in education has been MOOCs, otherwise
  known as Massively Open Online Courses. There has been a parade of new MOOC
  platforms over the last six months, with the most recognizable names now
  being Coursera, Udacity and EdX, the collaboration between Harvard, MIT and
  UC Berkeley. MOOCs have been pegged by some as representing the future of the
  educational system, democratizing education, bringing quality learning
  content to people of any age, in any corner of the world for a small fee
  &mdash; if not for free.</blockquote>

<h3 style="clear:none;">coursera</h3>

<p>Several companies, most notably <a
href="https://www.coursera.org/">coursera</a>, are offering these free courses
as an attempt to detect and hire new talent. </p>

<p>To develop the courses coursera teams with the most reputed universities, <a
href="https://www.coursera.org/partners">about 100 prestigious institutions
like Stanford, Georgia Tech and others</a>. </p>

<div class="imgR">
<img alt="logo edX" src="mooc/logo-edx.png" /></div>

<h3 style="clear:none;">edX</h3>

<p>Another institution is <a href="https://www.edx.org/course-list">edX</a>.
Check their own words: </p>

<div class="framed">

<blockquote>
  EdX offers interactive online classes and MOOCs from the world&rsquo;s best
  universities. Online courses from MITx, HarvardX, BerkeleyX, UTx and many
  other universities. Topics include biology, business, chemistry, computer
  science, economics, finance, electronics, engineering, food and nutrition,
  history, humanities, law, literature, math, medicine, music, philosophy,
  physics, science, statistics and more. EdX is a non-profit online initiative
  created by founding partners Harvard and MIT.</blockquote>
</div>

<p>They even offer <a
href="https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edx-edxdemo101-edx-demo-1038">a course
about their courses</a>. This is interesting for our purposes bacause it
showcases tha platform features all in a few minutes, and their platform was
recently opened. </p>

<h2 id="L115" style="clear:none;">MOOC at Globant</h2>

<p>I'm proposing that Globant jumped into the MOOC trend, by offering a
world-class battery of courses, initially about what we do best: <em>managing
IT development projects</em>. This is the single subject that would have the
most significant impact for the company, aligning all the managers behind a
tested set of best practices and ideas. </p>

<p>I think of a set of smaller courses. MOOCs usually span 4 to 10 weeks, I
think of a set (TBD) of correlated brief courses. </p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>The course, or </p>

<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>Software requirements 
    <p>Understanding how to understand the project goal, in detail. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Use cases 
    <p>Characteristics of effective UCs, as in Alistair Cockburn's book. </p>
  </li>
  <li>User stories 
    <p>What are USs and how they should be written. </p>
  </li>
  <li>The QA 150~ questions, in detail 
    <p>Detailed explanation and justification of each one, with examples and
    related testimonies of PMs. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Agile process 
    <p>Basic knowledge, and what the PM should check during the meetings in
    order for the team to stay on track and sustain speed. </p>

<h3 id="L409">Testing Globant U</h3>

<p>The link to <a
href="http://173.255.118.223:8080/globantu-web-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/">Globant U
courses</a> takes to a slightly non-standard login form with issues. </p>
<pre>Oops! Google Chrome could not connect to 173.255.118.223:8080</pre>

<h4 id="L418">Login form comments</h4>
<ol>
  <li>There is a "Reset" button 
    <p>Reset buttons are not used any more. In the nineties it was customary to
    set one in each and every form, and it was never used. Its function is to
    reset all the form's input fields to their original values, usually empty.
    It's only useful for lengthy forms used repeately. </p>
    <p>In this particular case the presence of a button labeled "Reset" add a
    bit of confusion because a user could think it's for resetting the
    password, duplicating the "Reset password" link. </p>
    <p>Suggestion: delete the "Reset" button. </p>
  </li>
  <li>There is no <em>remember me</em> option 
    <p>It is expected that the users come back to this site many times. Having
    to enter their credentials in full each and every time poses a small burden
    that slightly discourages the return, like Globant's "stars" program that
    is seldom used because it requires the glober to enter Glow. </p>
    <p>Suggestion: Add a me <em>remember me</em> option that not only remembers
    the credentials but also takes the user immediately to the last page
    accessed. Make the last page accessed thing so that it works even if the
    user is accessing the site from another device. </p>
  </li>
  <li>An error message breaks the layout Defects of this type tend to erode the
    user's trust on the site, conveying a sense of sloppyness that taints the
    whole site including the quality of the content. 
    <p>Suggestion: Add a <code>clear</code> to the Email label, or don't float
    the message. </p>
  </li>
  <li>The input fields have proportional sizes 
    <p>When the form is displayed too wide these fields are set too long for
    the intended content. The size of the input should give the user a hint
    about the size of the expected content. </p>
    <p>Suggestion: Set the fields with a fixed-proportional size, like
    <code>18em</code>. Set it rather big to encourage the use of lengthy
    passwords. Note that there is no need for both fields to be equal in size,
    but it's customary to do it so the user recognizes a login form
    immediately. </p>
  </li>
  <li>The links "Register" and "Reset password" are placed in opposition 
    <p>As these two links are of the same class, they should be placed in
    equivalent positions. The logical ordering is "Register" first because it
    designates an action that happens before. </p>
  </li>
  <li>The form was built with a responsive layout 
    <p>This is not apprppriate for login forms. Actually, was is not
    appropriate is that a simple login form spanned widths in excess of 750px.
    </p>
    <p>Also, in a viewport width of about 760px the layout breaks when there is
    a 350px wide error message artifact displayed into a 240px wide container.
    </p>
    <p>Suggestion: Avoid using bootstrap for this particular form, or make it
    fixed-width in units that don't depend on the screen resolution. </p>
  </li>
  <li>There is no indication of the kind of email required 
    <p>From the first User Registration step stems that the email is supposed
    to be a Globant email. Actually, entering another domain's email brings up
    a "This email address is not allowed" error message. </p>
    <p>Suggestion: Change the "Email:" label in the login form to "Globant
    email:". </p>
  </li>
  <li>There is no indication of the kind of email required 
    <p>In the first User Registration step, entering a non-Globant email brings
    up a "This email address is not allowed" error message. The message states
    that there is an error, but doesn't tell what is the error. The user has to
    guess (actually it's simple because the form asks for a Globant email, but
    anyway). </p>
    <p>Suggestion: Reword the message to something like "Only Globant emails
    accepted", or instead of the email ask for the plain user name without
    domain. </p>
  </li>
  <li>There is no indication of the password required 
    <p>It might be Globant's domain password, or a password specific for this
    site. Being that the identification is Globant's email the password might
    well be also Globant's. </p>
    <p>Suggestion: Make it clear, at least in the registration form, what is
    the password expected. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Dead end in user registration 
    <p>When the user tries to register the second time a "User already
    registered" message shows, the email input is erased, and the only
    available option is the same "Register" button. </p>
    <p>Suggestion: Provide a link to move out, like "Back" or whatever. Also,
    don't erase the input so the user can see which is the email that is
    triggering the error. </p>
  </li>
  <li>The "Password Reset" dialog does not state the requirements 
    <p>Entering a short or a simple password triggers a message "Please, check
    the password confirmation and the minimal length of 8". But nowhere in the
    form are the password quality requirements published. </p>
    <p>Suggestion: State the password quality requirements, and implement a
    client-side quality check instead of an "error" message. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Resetting the password leads to a dead end 
    <p>A "Password Reset" dialog from a previous attempt led to a page with a
    message "No user found with this email address" but the address in not
    shown and was not input in the previous step. </p>
    <p>Suggestion: Revise the flow of the registration and login subsystem. </p>
  </li>
  <li>The login form including a few of the suggested visual changes:

<h4 id="L526">Following the Web UI Certification track</h4>

<h5 id="L289">Track: Web UI Certification / Level 1 - Track 1 - Introduction to
Computer Programming</h5>

<p>Developing a course for the purpose of priming totally non-programmers is a
huge effort. On the other hand, such effort was already untertaken by a lot of
others. </p>

<p>I strongly suggest that we focus on new turf, and instead of running a
homebrew course for a few hundred globers wh think big and massively exhibit
our real power. </p>

<p>If we could leverage other people's courses we could focus in Globant's
reals strengths. The fact that in Globant there are many people who are great
programmers doesn't mean that we have the required expertise. Introductory
courses are most sensitive to the instructor's didactical abilities, which many
(not to say most) hardcore geeks completely lack. </p>

<p>A quick search, only in the coursera archives, returned a course named "<a
href="https://www.coursera.org/course/programming1">Learn to Program: The
Fundamentals</a>" which is currently finished but open and I plan to evaluate
because it can show interesting statistics: </p>
<pre># users registered at close of course: 66,510
# users who watched the first video:   48,520
# users who watched the last video:    10,935
# users who submitted the final exam:   8,600
# Statements of Accomplishment:         7,839 (11%)</pre>

<p>This is a very good record for a MOOC. </p>

<p>The course <a
href="http://coursetalk.org/coursera/learn-to-program-the-fundamentals">has 141
reviews</a> which might be useful for our purpose, with an average rating of
4.6 stars out of 5. It links to other similar courses: </p>

<p>Turns out that instead of one single course we could offer the globers a
wider choice so they can take the course that fits them better. </p>

<p><strong>Content comments</strong></p>

<p>The course is based in a set of lynda.com videos, published in youTube, that
are somehow outdated both regarding the content and also the approach. </p>
<ol>
  <li>This track, "Introduction to Programming", instead of being an integral
    part of the Web UI course should be a separate course by itself, bacause
    it's also basic in other courses. Instead of being a part it should be a
    prerequisite. </li>
  <li>The lynda.com videos in Lecture 1 contain a lot of ancilliary information
    that the student doesn't need yet, like the differences between compiled or
    interpreted languages, or information about machine code. 
    <p>IMO having to process all this information up front, in the first 15
    minutes, poses an arid landscape to the student who is eager to see some
    real code once and for all. </p>
    <p>IMO it should start with something like the content of the video in
    Syntax &rarr; Lecture 1 &rarr; Video 2</p>
  </li>
  <li>The slides in Lecture 1 have the same problem. I'd save the historical
    background for an upcoming class. </li>
  <li>Slide 18 in Lecture 1 is misleading. </li>
  <li>Slide 28 is a circular definition of OOP, smartes students will ignore
    it. </li>
  <li>Slide 34, about OOP inheritance, introduces a bad practice which is using
    pluralized names for classes. Plural names are for collections. </li>
  <li>Slide 39, about identifiers, is a bad explanation. Firstly, identifiers
    shouldn't be defined as "the names of objects" disregarding the fact that
    the word "object" has a special meaning in this context. Secondly, the
    "symbolically" term used is the right way to define this but it's used
    before being presented. And finally, there is no mention to function names
    as identifiers. </li>
  <li>In slide 45 "Structured Programming" is mentioned but was never defined
    (and will never be, I guess for now). </li>
  <li>Slide 47, about passing parameters by value, mentions the parameter
    concept which is not yet defined. </li>
  <li>Many other slides display conflictive content. IMO exposing the students
    who have no idea about programming to this material might harm them in an
    irreversible way. </li>
  <li>Syntax &rarr; Lecture 1 &rarr; Video 1, is severely outdated about the
    usages of the JavaScript language. </li>
  <li>Syntax &rarr; Lecture 1 &rarr; Video 5 is very good in how it explains
    some concepts about numeric variables. </li>
  <li>Sometimes there is no correlation between the laft hand pane and the
    content pane, i.e., it's not possible to find out which of the elements of
    the index is displayed as content. In the example, the title at the left
    don't match the titles at the top of the right content pane. 
    <p><img alt="not possible to relate index and content"
    src="mooc/course-noLetfRightConnection.png" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>The video at Classes &rarr; Functions &rarr; Lecture 1 &rarr; Video 4
    doesn't come up. </li>
  <li>IMO the word "Document" is too generic. Yes, it is a document. But
    designing it as "Document" is like to have a son and name him "Son". 
    <p>Suggestion: Instead of "Document" use the section names, like
    "Operators, If and Switch" or "Functions". </p>
  </li>
  <li>The content of the Globant branded "Document" of the "Functions" section
    is not carefully related to the content of the corresponding videos. </li>
  <li>The "Document" has links telling the student to watch the lecture videos.
    But, the videos are listed <em>before</em> de "Document" so the natural
    order would be to watch the videos and then open the "Document" that point
    to the same videos. 
    <p>Suggestion: If the "Document" has to be opened before in order to be led
    to the videos then set the link to the "Document" before the video linls.
    </p>
    <p>Also, if the videos are subordinate to the "Document" then the video
    links should also appear as subordinates of the appropriate "Document"
    link. </p>
  </li>
  <li>In Classes eee Iterations eee Lecture 1 eee Document eee Slide 16 the
    name of the video is wrong, repeated from the previous video. 
    <p>It should be "Creating a for loop". </p>
  </li>
  <li>Given that the videos have their own descriptive names, those names
    should be displayed in the left hand index, like "3 Creating a for loop".
    This is helpful for the students, for example in case they wanted to review
    a subject. With the current arrangement they must remember the correlation
    between video numbers and subjects, or open videos until they see one that
    has the right title. </li>
  <li>Each section should have a small assessment after if, for the students to
    know that they understood the basics or that they should review the
    subject. </li>
  <li>The lynda.com videos belong to lynda.com and one is supposed to pay for
    the right of using them. See <a
    href="https://www.google.com.ar/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDQQtwIwAQ&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lynda.com%2FJavaScript-tutorials%2FWorking-operators%2F81266%2F87525-4.html&amp;ei=qJbiUtT8OIePkAeup4HAAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEeXqS6lTGjoNFhdn3FYBSSPQzupw&amp;sig2=TKATzItvp016x0ZSoREuzQ&amp;bvm=bv.59930103,d.cWc">an
    example here</a>: as soon as I clicked "play" the site requested me to pay.
  </li>
  <li>In Support information &rarr; Lecture 1 &rarr; Video 1, the code examples
    are written in MEL and Python, while all the previous examples are written
    in JavaScript. IMO this is too bold for a forst contact with programming.
  </li>
  <li>The "Support Information" section videos are of much less quality than
    the previous ones. Also, these videos are focuse on startin programminf 4D
    models with Blender, which is a good thing, but IMO falls out of bounds in
    a course like this. </li>
  <li>The "Exam" is void. </li>
</ol>

<p></p>

<p><strong>UI &amp; interaction comments</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Videos have to open in the course window</li>
  <li>There must be a "next" button in each and every step</li>
  <li>Anyway, the hierarchy at the left panel has to highlight the currently
    selected item</li>
  <li>The hierarchy at the left somehow has to covey information about which
    items were already visited by the student</li>
  <li>Clicking compound items in the left hand hierarchy should display their
    sub-hierarchy in the content pane. </li>
  <li>There should be a set of back and forward buttons, for the student to
    backtrack his progress. Alternatively, stack their movements in the
    browser's history. </li>
  <li>There are many "Lecture 1" sections. This difficults references in
    questions. </li>
  <li>Getting back to the course doesn't open it in the last lesson accesed,
    neither the system remembers the state of the left hand side artifact
    (should display as it was when the page last closed). </li>
  <li>The "Documents" are written in different colors, several colors per
    slide, that convey no apparent meaning. The software code is usually
    displayed in different colors to highlight the syntax, but this is not the
