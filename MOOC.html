<p>Abstract: <br />
A proposal to start publishing courses with the Globant brand, to fulfill
internal needs and for detecting specially talented students and trying to
recruit them. <br />
Also Globant-branded MOOCs could be a path for Globant to get to be known by
its high-quality work inside companies using those courses internally. <br />
It is said that this is the shape of the future highschool education. </p>

<h2 id="L366">MOOC </h2>

<p>This section is brief information about the "MOOC" concept and the main
players. </p>

<p><a
href="2U One-Ups MOOCs, Coursera, Now Offers Online Undergrad Courses From Top Schools For Credit">TechCrunch
on MOOCs as of Nov 2012</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  Of late, one of the hottest subjects in education has been MOOCs, otherwise
  known as Massively Open Online Courses. There has been a parade of new MOOC
  platforms over the last six months, with the most recognizable names now
  being Coursera, Udacity and EdX, the collaboration between Harvard, MIT and
  UC Berkeley. MOOCs have been pegged by some as representing the future of the
  educational system, democratizing education, bringing quality learning
  content to people of any age, in any corner of the world for a small fee
  &mdash; if not for free.</blockquote>

<p>Several companies, most notably <a
href="https://www.coursera.org/">coursera</a>, are offering these free courses
as an attempt to detect and hire new talent. </p>

<p>For us there would be additional advantages, like implement internal
education, getting positioned, get other companies to know Globant, earn
prestige, rub our shouders with globally prestigious universities, step into
the future of highschool education. </p>

<p>Follow this link to get into <a href="MOOC-links.html"
 target="_blank">a page loaded with
relevant MOOC links</a>. </p>

<h3 style="clear:none;" id="L2635">coursera</h3>

<div class="imgR">
<img alt="logo coursera" src="mooc/logo-coursera.png" /> </div>

<p>To develop the courses coursera teams with the most reputed universities, <a
href="https://www.coursera.org/partners">about 100 prestigious institutions
like Stanford, Georgia Tech and others</a>. </p>

<h3 style="clear:none;" id="L2642">edX</h3>

<div class="imgR">
<img alt="logo edX" src="mooc/logo-edx.png" /></div>

<p>Another institution is <a href="https://www.edx.org/course-list">edX</a>.
Check their own words: </p>

<div class="framed">

<blockquote>
  EdX offers interactive online classes and MOOCs from the world&rsquo;s best
  universities. Online courses from MITx, HarvardX, BerkeleyX, UTx and many
  other universities. Topics include biology, business, chemistry, computer
  science, economics, finance, electronics, engineering, food and nutrition,
  history, humanities, law, literature, math, medicine, music, philosophy,
  physics, science, statistics and more. EdX is a non-profit online initiative
  created by founding partners Harvard and MIT.</blockquote>
</div>

<p>edX even offers <a
href="https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edx-edxdemo101-edx-demo-1038">a course
about their courses</a>. This is interesting for our purposes because it
showcases all the platform features in a few minutes walkthrough, and their
platform was recently opened. </p>

<h2 id="L115" style="clear:none;">MOOC at Globant</h2>

<div class="imgL">
<img alt="logo Globant" src="mooc/logo-globant.png" /></div>

<p>I'm proposing that Globant jumped into the MOOC trend, by offering a
world-class battery of courses, initially about what we do best: <em>managing
IT development projects</em>. </p>

<p>This is the single subject that would have the most significant impact for
the company, effective over all the projects, aligning all the managers behind
a tested set of best practices and ideas. </p>

<p>MOOCs usually span 4 to 10 weeks, I think of a set (TBD) of correlated brief
courses, each one much smaller than regular MOOCs, designed so that busy people
can take them in spare time, but following a predefined structured path, like
the prerequisites for enrolling in university courses. </p>

<h3 id="L2677">Proposed course subjects</h3>

<p>Each subject would lead to a single course or a set of courses, depending on
its width. </p>
<dl>
  <dt>Software requirements </dt>
    <dd>Understanding how to understand the project goal, in detail. </dd>
  <dt>Use cases </dt>
    <dd>Characteristics of effective UCs, as in Alistair Cockburn's book. </dd>
  <dt>User stories </dt>
    <dd>What are USs and how they should be written. </dd>
  <dt>The QA 150 questions, in detail </dt>
    <dd>Detailed explanation and justification of each one, with examples and
      related real-life testimonials of PMs. </dd>
  <dt>Agile process </dt>
    <dd>Basic knowledge, and what the PM should check during the meetings in
      order for the team to stay on track and sustain speed. </dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="L2821">Course sources</h3>

<p>There are two facets to make a course: the content and the form. </p>

<h4 id="L2882">Content sources</h4>

<p>We can summon the most recognized teachers and ask them to participate
providing class material that they have already been using for years. </p>

<p>Ideally those teachers would be somehow "sponsored" by the University they
work for. The University would provide the academic prestige, and Globant the
technical framework. </p>

<p>The teachers should be enticed to participate in order to gain fame and
future credibility. Actually, their gain could be important, like to be invited
to dictate classes in foreign countries. </p>

<p>The courses will be advertised as "course by professor X, University Y,
powered by Globant". </p>

<p>Also, we should ask outstanding Globant managers to share their wisdom, in
order to have at least par ot it preserved in case they leave the Company or
change their position. </p>

<h4 id="L2921">Form shaping</h4>

<p>The ability to shape a course so that it's solid but amenable, conveying the
knowledge advertised by the title, packaged into the state-of-the-art MOOC
form, is something we need to develop and provide as a service to those
approaching to publish through our platform. </p>

<p>We must develop best practices and make them available, by sure as a MOOC
building course. </p>

<p>It is important for the Globant-branded courses to be just perfect because
the courses quality will be evaluated by those who see it as a measure for the
quality of our products. </p>

<h3 id="L2707">Software platform</h3>

<p>There are two open source MOOC system: edX's and one developed in Spain.
Both look good. </p>

<p>We have to choose one and run it in one of our servers. </p>

<p>The platform has to be intervened in order for it to fulfill our purposes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>deliver both internal and public courses keeping the domains separated,
    and</li>
  <li>keep a detailed track of each student's performance. </li>
</ul>

<p>The platform should run with a "powered by Globant" branding, independent of
the course source. </p>

<p>One goal can be to make Globant the leading MOOC platform operator of all
Latin America. </p>

<p>This would allow us (with the right agreements) to screen the participants
of many MOOCs developed by somebody anywhere, mostly universities, and detect
fresh outstanding talent. </p>

<h3>Balance</h3>

<div>
<p>Pros: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Detect exceptional talent</li>
  <li>Provide and consume internal education</li>
  <li>Get in contact and be associated with, other prominent MOOC players</li>
  <li>Be seen as a CSR company</li>
  <li>Get other companies to know Globant</li>
  <li>Anchor (at least part of) the gained experience inside the company</li>
  <li>Communicate knowledge accross the company branches</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<p>Cons: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Spend money (that might be regarded as charity donations)  </li>
  <li>We haven't started yet. </li>
</ul>
