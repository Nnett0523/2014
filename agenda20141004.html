<h3>Semantic text tagging</h3>

<h4>A short example</h4>

<p>The core is the <em>semantic tagging</em> of the texts, a means to overcome
the current (and by sure enduring) lack of common sense of the computers. Let's
illustrate with a simple contrived example. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>open windows</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the text above both words have more than one meaning. The word "open" can
be one of the many forms of "to open" like for example the imperative, or an
adjective. The predicate "windows" can refer to a glassed aperture in the wall,
a time lapse, or a computer operating system. </p>

<p>Translating this piece of text into Spanish could yield "abre ventanas" (do
open windows), or "ventanas abiertas" (opened windows) , or "inicia Windows"
(do start Windows). </p>

<p>If the text was <em>semantically tagged</em> the translation would be more
precise. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p id="L84"><code>&lt;p lang="en"&gt;&lt;semanticInfo="imperative of to
  open"&gt;</code><strong>open</strong><code>&lt;/semanticInfo&gt;</code>
  <code>&lt;semanticInfo="noun: an opening, usually covered by one or more
  panes of clear glass, to allow light and air from outside to enter a building
  or
  vehicle"&gt;</code><strong>windows</strong><code>&lt;/semanticInfo&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would severely constrain the chances of the translator program to do
funny things. </p>

<p>In addition to tag the meaning of ambiguous words, we should especially tag
idioms, proverbs and phrasal verbs, sayings that depart from the literal
meaning of the words. </p>

<h4>Little he knew ...</h4>

<p>This saying, on which the film <a
href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Stranger_Than_Fiction_%28film%29"
target="_second"><em>Stranger than reality</em></a> pivots, is an example of a
phrase needing cautious translation. Some literal translations wouldn't work.
</p>

<p>The semantic information for this phrase is that a third person is informing
the reader that something unexpected is about to happen, or happened, to an
unaware subject. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shakespeare knew only a little Latin, but he put the <strong>little he
  knew</strong> to very good use</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://tatoeba.org/eng/sentences/show/53858"
target="_second">sentence above</a> contains the same exact words but with a
completely different meaning. </p>

<p>Little we know, as of today, about what could be the outcome of this
<em>text tagging</em> thing, maybe a huge impact in the textual communitations
through computers between different cultures. </p>

<h4>What are would be benefits?</h4>

<h5>A single translation for all languages</h5>

<p>Tagged texts can be automatically translated to <em>any</em> language
yielding non-embarrasing results by means of a modified translator program,
which is assumed to exist for now (this has still to be verified). </p>

<p>A text translated from English to <em>tagged English</em> could be used as a
source for any other language. </p>

<h5>Much better search results</h5>

<p>There will be two results levels: the new <em>semantic</em> and the current
<em>lexical</em>. </p>

<p>Semantic search results are matches of one selected meaning of a word
against that same meaning found in tagged texts. </p>

<p>For example one that is planning the building of a house can search for
"windows" as apertures and filter out all the humongouns set of
windows-as-an-OS matches. </p>

<p>All the windows makers that publish web sites in English will want to be in
the semantic set of search results. </p>

<p>After a while, usability tests will demonstrate that search users almost
don't go beyond the semantic set, because of the extra effort needed to filter
the results. </p>

<h5>A companion for readers</h5>

<p>Anyone reading a tagged text and seeking deeper understanding can query it
to be explained its meaning. </p>

<p>Be it a person reading the news or classic literature; in their mother
language or a foreign one. Reading for the sake of reading, or while studying
the language. </p>

<p>We have online dictionaries that can provide us all the meanings of a word;
this will provide the exact meaning intended for the current instance of the
word. Not a listing of possible meanings but the current one. </p>

<h4>Who would do the text tagging?</h4>

<h5>Professional <em>test taggers</em></h5>

<p>A new profession will be born, somewhere in between copy proofing and
literary critic. </p>

<h5>Lawyers and poets</h5>

<p>In the future the text of an international contract will need to be tagged
in order to avoid "lost in translation" issues. The meaning constrains will be
valuable, and the tagging of legal copy will be done by law and domain experts.
</p>

<p>Poets will say that the tagging of texts doesn't leave much for the
imagination, and in some cases this will be the desired outcome. </p>

<h5>English students and teachers (English or any other language
whatsoever)</h5>

<p>One of the most boring tasks in the whole world is to prepare exam tests.
</p>

<p>Text tagging comes to the rescue, providing language teachers an endless
source of fresh excercises. </p>

<p>Depending on the level, the student can be posed two different types of
tests. The simple ones show a word in the context of a paragraph and the
student has to choose its meaning from a multiple choices list. A slightly
higher level student sees not a word but an idiom (like a phrasal verb) and
chooses the meaning. The teacher U <span
style="background-color:#ffff00">OIUYIYIUYNOIYOIUYNIYNOIUNNINinuyi</span>
uyiuyniu yn&lt;oiuyniuynoiuyniy</p>

<p>In all cases, the student can choose an "other" option when there is none
that fits. </p>

<h5>Gamers</h5>

<p>Gamers of "Taming the translator", earning points by adding semantic hints
to a piece of text until the translator can do a decent (or excellent) job. </p>

<h4>The dictionary</h4>

<p>Tagging <a href="#L84">each word with its complete description</a> is
impractical. The web-right way is to relate each word with a set of URIs
pointing to each word meaning, after some <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming" target="_second">stemming</a> to
take plural or gender inflections. </p>

<p>The tag for the word "windows" should be something similar to: </p>

<p><code>&lt;p
lang="en"&gt;&lt;semanticInfo="http://en.adictionary.net/window?1"&gt;</code></p>

<p>The tag URI refers to the first entry ("?1") of the "window" entry from the
English version of the shared dictionary. </p>

<p>It points to content similar to <a
href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/window" target="_second">the "window" entry
in Wiktionary</a>, that looks like: </p>

<div class="framed">
<ol>
  <li>An opening, usually covered by one or more panes of clear glass, to allow
    light and air from outside to enter a building or vehicle.</li>
  <li>An opening, usually covered by glass, in a shop which allows people to
    view the shop and its products from outside. </li>
  <li>(<em>architecture</em>) The shutter, casement, sash with its fittings, or
    other framework, which closes a window opening.</li>
  <li>A period of time when something is available. 
    <dl>
        <dd><i><span lang="en" class="Latn">launch <b>window</b>;&emsp;
          <b>window</b> of opportunity</span></i></dd>
        <dd><i><span lang="en" class="Latn">You have a two-hour <b>window</b>
          of clear weather to finish working on the lawn.</span></i></dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li>(<em>graphical user interface</em>) A rectangular area on a computer
    terminal or screen containing some kind of user interface, displaying the
    output of and allowing input for one of a number of simultaneously running
    computer processes.</li>
  <li>A figure formed of lines crossing each other. </li>
  <li>(<em>added</em>) An operating system for personal computers. </li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>Actually most of the URI can be built from information in the page: the
language is declared in general, the dictionary domain is known data, the word
id part of the text. The only additional information needed is the ordinal
number that point to the specific word meaning and, if we agreed that if it's
missing then the first one is the choice then the URI vanishes in full. </p>

<h4>Not a single dictionary</h4>

<p>The process of tagging great quantities of text should yield also an
ever-evolving dictionary. </p>

<p>Having a single dictionary for all sounds somehow Orwellian. Actually,
people should have freedom to point to any dictionary of their choice. </p>

<p>This is a business opportunity, where businesses can build their own
dictionaries as services. For example <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LexisNexis">LexisNexis</a> could offer a
specialized dictionary fine tuned for legal copy, cascading into the general
dictionary for terms not found in theirs. </p>

<p>As another example, there is the <a
href="http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/" target="_second">Department
of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms</a> that contains a few
words to be used whre appropriate. </p>

<h4>Not only words in the dictionary</h4>

<p>The meaning of each word is important, but there are also that sequences of
words that, in the appropriate context, acquire different meanings. </p>

<p>For example in "these new products provide more bang for the buck" or "this
is a pain in the ass". </p>

<p>The semantic tagging not only tags words but also prases that are to be
taken as idions and need special consideration for their translation. </p>

<p>In most cases it might be possible to provide, within the idioms dictionary
information, a piece of replacement text that means more or less the same as
the idiom but can stand a straighforward translation. </p>

<p>Moreover, many idioms and proverbs have equivalents in other languages that
should be the replacement text after adapting number and gender where needed.
For example "The early bird gets the worm" is "Al que madruga Dios lo ayuda",
completely different but conveying the same meaning. </p>
