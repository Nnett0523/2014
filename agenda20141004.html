<h3>Semantic text tagging</h3>

<h4>A short example</h4>

<p>The core is the <em>semantic tagging</em> of the texts. Let's illustrate
with a simple contrived example. The text is: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>open windows</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both words have more than one meaning. The verb "open" can be one of many
forms of "to open", like for example the imperative, or an adjective. The
predicate "windows" can refer to a glassed aperture in the wall or to an
operating system. </p>

<p>Translating this piece of text into Spanish could yield "abre ventanas", or
"ventanas abiertas", or "inicia Windows". </p>

<p>We have an opportunity to be amused by those weird automatic translations.
</p>

<p>If the text was <em>semantically tagged</em> it wouldn't happen that easy.
For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>&lt;semanticInfo="imperative of to
  open"&gt;</code><strong>open</strong><code>&lt;/semanticInfo&gt;</code>
  <code>&lt;semanticInfo="noun: a framework of wood or metal that contains a
  glass windowpane and is built into a wall or roof to admit light or air,
  plural"&gt;</code><strong>windows</strong><code>&lt;/semanticInfo&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would severely constrain the chances of the translator program to do
funny things. </p>

<p>In addition to tag the meaning of ambiguous words, we souls especially tag
idioms and phrasal verbs, sayings that depart from the literal meaning of the
words. </p>

<h4>Little he knew ...</h4>

<p>This saying, on which the film "Stranger than reality" pivots, is an example
of a phrase needing cautious translation. The literal translation doesn't work.
in Spanish there is no equivalent idion, just the plain "Él no sabía que ...".
</p>

<h4>What are the benefits?</h4>

<h5>A single translation for all languages</h5>

<p>Tagged texts can be automatically translated to <em>any</em> language
yielding non-embarrasing results. Of course, by means of a modified translator
program, which is assumed to exist for now. </p>

<p>A text translated from English to <em>tagged English</em> could be used as a
source for any other language.  </p>

<h5>A companion for readers</h5>

<p>Anyone reading a tagged text and seeking deeper understanding can query it
to be explained its meaning. </p>

<p>Be it a person reading the news or classic literature; in their mother
language or a foreign one. Reading for the sake of reading, or while studying
the language. </p>

<p>We have online dictionaries that can provide us all the meanings of a word;
this will provide the exact meaning intended for the current instance of the
word. </p>

<h4>Who would do the text tagging?</h4>

<h5>Professional <em>test taggers</em></h5>

<p>A new profession will be born, somewhere in between copy proofing and
literary critic. </p>

<h5>Lawyers and poets</h5>

<p>In the future the text of an international contract will need to be tagged
in order to avoid "lost in translation" issues. The meaning constrains will be
valuable, and the tagging of legal copy will be done by law and domain experts.
</p>

<p>Poets will say that the tagging of texts doesn't leave much for the
imagination, and in some cases this will be the desired outcome. </p>

<ul>
  <li>Teachers in language classes, displaying a text and grading a particular
    significate</li>
  <li>Gamers "taming the translator" earning points by providing semantic hints
    to a piece of text until the translator does a decent (or excellent)
  job</li>
  <li>Between no more and drink a chair </li>
