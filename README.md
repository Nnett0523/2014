Pages for year 2014

It contains HTML pages, one for each day of the year, and a "res" directory with resources. 

I use these pages to store daily notes and links, editing them with W3C's Amaya editor and browser. 
Amaya is good because it is so WYSIWYG, that is, there is no difference between the browse and the edit views, it's not plagued with editor tools. 
The downside is that Amaya development was stopped years ago ...
  
The res directory contains a script that generates the pages after a model, it's a js program that runs in node.js. 
There is also an Excel file that might be used too.
