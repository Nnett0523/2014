<h3>Building the application's UI</h3>

<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>In developers lingo, <em>build</em> means making a production version of the
application ("project") out of the myriad of files needed for the development
tasks. The production version is intended to be deployed in the production
servers, albeit there are also test builds. </p>

<p>The building process is a frequently reiterated set of repetitive tasks and
thus it's more than suitable for automation. </p>

<p>Automating the build of Java applications is done using a tool named <em><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Maven">Maven</a></em> while the
currently popular tool for building JavaScript applications (like this app's
UI) is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grunt">Grunt</a>. There are
different tools that address the different needs of eath type of build. </p>

<p>Ideally there would be to have two separate projects, one for the Java
backend and the other for the HTML + CSS + JavaScript UI, because decoupling
both ends conveys the best economic results by saving lots of inter-team
interactions and fostering a better technical design. </p>

<p>Next to the ideal is to have a building process comprised of the overarching
Java build including the UI build as a step. This is the usual arrangement when
the application ends are not yet decoupled. </p>

<p>The steps of a build process do things like checking the source code for
correctness, running the unit tests (and stopping the build if the failures
levels breaks a given threshold), compiling the sources, cramming the whole
application into a compressed .war file, etc. </p>

<p>Additionally, build tools help ensure that all the project dependencies are
fulfilled. This is a chore, so being able to rest assured that all the needed
libraries are available and up to date is a really nice service. </p>

<p>Both the Java backend and the UI require similar steps, only that in each
case the actions are performed by different tools, mostly Java tools for the
Java part, and JavaScript tools for the UI. </p>

<p>Fortunately Grunt (the UI builder) can be run from within Maven (the Java
builder). This is what we will be doing in this application as long as its ends
remain coupled. </p>

<h3>Grunt</h3>

<p><a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> is defined as a <em>JavaScript task
runner</em>, an automation tool. This means it's a tool that accepts the
definition of a task sequence to be run following a certain protocol. A
relevant feature of said protocol is that if a step fails the whole run will
fail (if that step is so configured). </p>

<p>For example, if a unit tests fails the build process will be stopped. </p>

<p>As Grunt is a JavaScript tool it requires an interpreter to run, which is <a
href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> that has to be installed in the build
server. Node is Google Chrome browser's JavaScript interpreter running in the
backend, with the addition ls networking and file system access. </p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<h3>Maven</h3>

<p>The all-encompassing build process is performed by running Maven against the
<code>pom.xml</code> file that is stored in the client-profile root directory.
