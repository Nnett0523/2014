<h3>1458 - Portlet-Background colour</h3>

<p><em>"Portlet Background colour Style Is currently in line with style guide
for heirarcle charts but is too heavy for the dashboard. - Remove hex #9d9d9d
and make it #fff. The divider lines should be #ccc.Text #333"</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>background #9d9d9d &rarr; #fff $portlet-background</li>
  <li>divider lines &rarr; #ccc $portlet-divider</li>
  <li>text &rarr; #333 $portlet-text</li>
</ul>
<pre>// portlet - .expandableBar and result-heading
$portlet-background: #9d9d9d; // should be #fff
$portlet-background-hover: #9d9d9d - 10;
$portlet-divider: 1px solid #ffffff; // should be #ccc;
$portlet-text: #333;</pre>

<p>Other changes needed: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Deleted the background of the jump icon and its border too</li>
  <li>Made a hover color close to the background color - 10 (#ffffff -&gt;
    #f6f6f6)</li>
  <li>For the next hierarchy level I applied the same colors, although I think
    it should be better to change them somehow. </li>
  <li>With the data fully expanded, the Name/Role/Phone/Email headers should be
    given a header look. </li>
  <li>I removed the background color of the "jump to application" icon too, now
    the icon is transparent as the guide shows. We should use two icon images,
    one normal and the other hovered, instead of the silly bg changes I
    implemented. </li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>The portlet is not style-guide compliant (page 34): </p>

<table class="borderTable">
  <col>
  <col>
  <col>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>element</th>

<h3>How do we work, and why</h3>

<h4>the workflow</h4>
<ol>
  <li>We, as a sub-team, have a set of pending issues that we call "the
    backlog" following the agile terminology. </li>
  <li>I short meetings (like 5' long) we choose which issue will start each one
    of us, our local TL (Andrés) validates the choices. </li>
  <li>We are using Git on SVN (the git-svn feature) so we create
    (<em>checkout</em> in Git parlance) a new branch to isolate the forthcoming
    code changes to a potentially high number of files. The branch is given a
    significant number, after the Jira card, including its number. Having the
    changes isolated in a branch allows us to revert then in case we needed to
    do so, to see the detail in a diff tool, or to stash them locally in case
    we had half-baked changes and needed to switch to another task. </li>
  <li>Now comes the easiest part and the most rewarding, which is to do the
    coding so the issue gets solved. This part <a href="#codingWorkflow">is
    depicted separately</a>. </li>
  <li>When the developer thinks the code is ready, after having tested it, he
    asks for a <em>code review</em>. He asks another developer of the team for
    the review. 
    <p>The owner of the changes shows the reviewer the changes made, in great
    detail, using a diff tool (SVN has a good one). </p>
    <p>It is the responsibility of the reviewer to get to understand the
    changes in detail and to suggest changes if he sees that any good practices
    are vulnerated. </p>
    <p>The aurhor of the changes is asked to show and explain the code, to show
    how it works both in a browser and in IE8, and to show any other related
    files. </p>
    <p></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p> </p>

<h4 id="codingWorkflow">Step 4 - coding: </h4>
<ol>
  <li>The owner of the issue defines a strategy to solve it.</li>
  <li>The strategy is validated discussing it with the others, and eventually
    asking for definitions to other members of the whole team (local and
    remote), personally or via chat in order to have quick answers because
    these undefinitions are blocking. </li>
  <li></li>
</ol>

<p> </p>

<h4>Step 5 - code review:</h4>

<p>Code reviewing is a QA (Quality Assurance) practice. QA strives to prevent
defects, as opposed to QC (Quality Control) that detects defects after they
happened. QA happens <em>before</em> while QC happens <em>after</em>. QA beats
QC by leaps and bounds, and is's much less expensive because it doesn´t involve
any rework but in the early development stages. </p>

<h3>Look darling, I resized the children!</h3>

<p>In web UI development there are may instances when the widths of a set of
contained items have to be adjusted due to a change in the container's width.
</p>

<h4>available solutions</h4>

<p>AFAIK there are these approaches: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Giving all children a percent width so that the sum of all widths is
    slightly less than 100%, and</li>
  <li>Having only two elements, fixing one element's width and floating it, and
    setting the other elemtn's width to auto in order to create a <em><a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Block_formatting_context">block
    formatting context</a></em> as in <a
    href="http://jsfiddle.net/fct87qpn/1/">this example</a>. </li>
  <li>Bind the resize event to a JavaScript function that recalculates all the
    widths according to a given policy. </li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these two methods ensure full tityness on resize. </p>

<p>The percents method is restrictive in that all the contained elements are
resized proportionally and while this can be desirable in some cases, it won't
in many others like for example one or more elements have fixed widths, minimum
widths, or don't look good when widened beyond a number. </p>

<p>The BFC method is restrictive in that it works for two and only two
elements. Yes, one can create nested BFCs, but it's cumbersome and still
restrictive. </p>

<p>The third method, using a function, is the most versatile but on the
downside it requires the function to be written, tested and mantained, which is
overkill for many small instances of the problem. </p>

<h4>generalizing the problem</h4>

<p>The children resizing scenarios that I can think of are a combination of the
following methods, where each child can cater from its preferred one: </p>
<ul>
  <li>fixed width</li>
  <li>percent of the container's width (with optional max and min
  constraints)</li>
  <li>proportional (same as percent only not 100-based)</li>
  <li>percent of another's element width</li>
  <li>largest text in a list</li>
  <li>largest text in a table column (up to a limit)</li>
  <li>all the remaining space</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems possible to write a program implementing all these strategies,
after getting enough information. </p>

<p>For example the resizing needs of a 3-elements set could be addressed by a
jQuery plugin parameterized thus: </p>
<pre>$('#threeItemsContainer').tidyResize([</pre>
<pre>    {strategy:percent, width:25%, max-width:120px},
    {strategy:collct},
    {strategy:fixed, width:50px} </pre>
<pre>]);</pre>
