<h3>Taking course: Web UI Certification / Level 1 - Track 2 - Web
Development</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The enrollment pesses the user through the sign in form, which is
    implemented as a separate page. After signing in it tekes the user back to
    the courses listing, but not in the same scroll position. This forces the
    user to search again for the course in irder to click its "Go to class"
    button. 
    <p>Suggestion: Replace the "Enroll" button by a "Go to course" that takes
    the user to a "course's home page" with details about the course (like a
    picture of the author, a related image or a screenshot) and put the
    "Enroll" button in that course homa page and do the whole enroll thing
    there, including abiding to the conduct code. Thus, if the action requires
    signin in the user would be taken back to the exact place where she was
    before. </p>
  </li>
  <li>The left-hand index starts with a root "Classes" item. This is pointless,
    because it's not functional and thus only adds noise. 
    <p>Suggestion: do not show the "Classes" item in the left-hand item. </p>
  </li>
  <li>The first element og the left-hand index is labeled "Program". This is
    not good English. 
    <p>Suggestion: Replace "Program" by "Syllabus". </p>
  </li>
  <li>The "Program" element is a 3-level structure thus: 
    <ul>
      <li>Classes
        <ul>
          <li>Program
            <ul>
              <li>Lecture 1
                <ul>
                  <li>Video 1</li>
                  <li>Document</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The only actionable item is "Document". There is no video, and this
    doesn't qualify as a lecture, thus such labeling is misleading. </p>
    <p>Suggestion: Link the "Document" to the first level and delete all the
    other non-functional levels. </p>
  </li>
  <li>The first videos give the student a historical review of the making of
    the Internet and social media. This, albeit interesting, is not essential
    knowledge for the developer to be, who might already know most of it. Also,
    this poses a semantic layer while the student is aiming at the underlaying
    technologies. 
    <p>Suggestion: Take these videos from the mainstream course and tag them as
    interesting optional material for the curious. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Video 5, about widgets, is a commercial from somewhere, that implies a
    lot of the knowledge this course is supposed to provide. 
    <p>Suggestion: Turn down this video. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
