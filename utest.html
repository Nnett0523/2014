<h2 id="L75">Test methodology</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The test is of the "<a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_testing#Expert_review">Expert
    Review</a>" kind. It differs from the usual ER methodology in that it was
    performed by a single <em>expert</em> while for expert reviews it's
    normally recommended to gather several reviewers. </li>
  <li>All usability reviews are dated, because the target UI is inevitably
    compared to other state-of-the-art current UIs. As we progress in the
    making of better and better UIs, what was good some time ago, tuenr sout to
    be inacceptable according to current standards. This test is performed as
    of January 2014 and the informal comparison is made against coursera MOOCs.
  </li>
  <li>Caveat: These reports, because of their nature, are all about the UI
    things that are not perfect. Less experienced developers who authored the
    reviewed system tend to resent the comments, while the most evolved take is
    the same as QC bug reports: great opportunities to get it better. </li>
</ul>

<p>HFI <a
href="http://www.humanfactors.com/services/expertreview.asp">describes ERs
thus</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Expert reviews are usability reality checks that result in immediate and
  concrete fixes to improve your customers' or staffs' experience. Fresh eyes
  review a design against industry standards and current research on how humans
  think and interact with things. An Expert Review is an important technique
  because it's often hard for designers to recognize usability trouble spots in
  their own designs. They created the task flow. They know how it works. When
  followed by Usability Testing, an Expert Review ensures that an
  organization's usability investment is optimized.</p>

<h3 id="L409">Testing Globant U</h3>

<p>The test reports struggling against the register/login flow, and taking the
"Web UI Certification / Level 1 - Track 1 - Introduction to Computer
Programming" course. </p>

<h4 id="L105">Entering: Sign in form sequence</h4>

<p>The link to <a
href="http://173.255.118.223:8080/globantu-web-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/">Globant U
courses</a> takes to a slightly non-standard login form. </p>

<h5 id="L418">Sign in and registration form comments</h5>

<p>This worked as if the registration part was not fully developed. Like for
example, the landing page lacks a "Register" link for the newcomers. I liked
the minimalist design, but it might convey a sense of rejections for those who
come for the first time. </p>
<ol>
  <li>There is a "Reset" button 
    <p>Reset buttons are not used any more. In the nineties it was customary to
    set one in each and every form, and it was never used. Its function is to
    reset all the form's input fields to their original values, usually empty.
    It's only useful for lengthy forms used repeately. </p>
    <p>In this particular case the presence of a button labeled "Reset" add a
    bit of confusion because a user could think it's for resetting the
    password, duplicating the "Reset password" link. </p>
    <p>Suggestion: delete the "Reset" button. </p>
  </li>
  <li>There is no <em>remember me</em> option 
    <p>It is expected that the users come back to this site many times. Having
    to enter their credentials in full each and every time poses a small burden
    that slightly discourages the return, like Globant's "stars" program that
    is seldom used because it requires the glober to enter Glow. </p>
    <p>Suggestion: Add a me <em>remember me</em> option that not only remembers
    the credentials but also takes the user immediately to the last page
    accessed. Make the last page accessed thing so that it works even if the
    user is accessing the site from another device. </p>
  </li>
  <li>An error message breaks the layout Defects of this type tend to erode the
    user's trust on the site, conveying a sense of sloppyness that taints the
    whole site including the quality of the content. 
    <p>Suggestion: Add a <code>clear</code> to the Email label, or don't float
    the message. </p>
  </li>
  <li>The input fields have proportional sizes 
    <p>When the form is displayed too wide these fields are set too long for
    the intended content. The size of the input should give the user a hint
    about the size of the expected content. </p>
    <p>Suggestion: Set the fields with a fixed-proportional size, like
    <code>18em</code>. Set it rather big to encourage the use of lengthy
    passwords. Note that there is no need for both fields to be equal in size,
    but it's customary to do it so the user recognizes a login form
    immediately. </p>
  </li>
  <li>The links "Register" and "Reset password" are placed in opposition 
    <p>As these two links are of the same class, they should be placed in
    equivalent positions. The logical ordering is "Register" first because it
    designates an action that happens before. </p>
  </li>
  <li>The form was built with a responsive layout 
    <p>This is not apprppriate for login forms. Actually, was is not
    appropriate is that a simple login form spanned widths in excess of 750px.
    </p>
    <p>Also, in a viewport width of about 760px the layout breaks when there is
    a 350px wide error message artifact displayed into a 240px wide container.
    </p>
    <p>Suggestion: Avoid using bootstrap for this particular form, or make it
    fixed-width in units that don't depend on the screen resolution. </p>
  </li>
  <li>There is no indication of the kind of email required 
    <p>From the first User Registration step stems that the email is supposed
    to be a Globant email. Actually, entering another domain's email brings up
    a "This email address is not allowed" error message. </p>
    <p>Suggestion: Change the "Email:" label in the login form to "Globant
    email:". </p>
  </li>
  <li>There is no indication of the kind of email required 
    <p>In the first User Registration step, entering a non-Globant email brings
    up a "This email address is not allowed" error message. The message states
    that there is an error, but doesn't tell what is the error. The user has to
    guess (actually it's simple because the form asks for a Globant email, but
    anyway). </p>
    <p>Suggestion: Reword the message to something like "Only Globant emails
    accepted", or instead of the email ask for the plain user name without
    domain. </p>
  </li>
  <li>There is no indication of the password required 
    <p>It might be Globant's domain password, or a password specific for this
    site. Being that the identification is Globant's email the password might
    well be also Globant's. </p>
    <p>Suggestion: Make it clear, at least in the registration form, what is
    the password expected. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Dead end in user registration 
    <p>When the user tries to register the second time a "User already
    registered" message shows, the email input is erased, and the only
    available option is the same "Register" button. </p>
    <p>Suggestion: Provide a link to move out, like "Back" or whatever. Also,
    don't erase the input so the user can see which is the email that is
    triggering the error. </p>
  </li>
  <li>The "Password Reset" dialog does not state the requirements 
    <p>Entering a short or a simple password triggers a message "Please, check
    the password confirmation and the minimal length of 8". But nowhere in the
    form are the password quality requirements published. </p>
    <p>Suggestion: State the password quality requirements, and implement a
    client-side quality check instead of an "error" message. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Resetting the password leads to a dead end 
    <p>A "Password Reset" dialog from a previous attempt led to a page with a
    message "No user found with this email address" but the address in not
    shown and was not input in the previous step. </p>
    <p>Suggestion: Revise the flow of the registration and login subsystem. </p>
  </li>
  <li>The login form including a few of the suggested visual changes: 

    <div style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="mooc/login-mofifiedForm.png" alt="Sign in modified"></div>
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>Although the link was correctly labeled "Sign in", the form in intitles
    "Login". This is a minor lack of consistency. 
    <p>Suggestion: Always use "Sign in" in all pages. Not "Login" that is
    generally being phased out. </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h5 id="L227">Courses listing</h5>

<p>The landing page seems to be the courses listing. </p>

<p style="width:100%;"><img alt="courses listing" style="width:100%;"
src="mooc/courses-listing.png"></p>
<ul>
  <li>Showing always the complete courses listing could end up being completely
    pointless, for example if there were a hundred or more entries. 
    <p>Suggestion: Take the student to her own landing page, containing the
    list of courses chosen, and a link to the last position in the last course
    opened. </p>
  </li>
  <li>The page is laid out with bootstrap, but it doesn't behave. The snapshot
    above is the narrowest possible in a notebook (1280 x 800). 
    <p>Suggestion: Fix the layout so this page behaves in handheld devices. </p>
  </li>
  <li>The layout of the page is not scannable. The course names are crammed in
    cells of a too-narrow column and in general the layout is not readable
    neither responsive. 
    <p>Suggestions: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Set the course titles in a bolder font, spanning the full width of
        the content column. </li>
      <li>Drop the table layout and use divs to be able to make it responsive
        by manipulating the "display" CSS property.</li>
      <li>Don't highlight the whole course data on hover, it's a clickable
        affordance that's not honored. </li>
      <li>Delete the first headings row. It's obvious and useless, and with the
        suggested layout inaccurate. </li>
      <li>Do not show the course duration as the first item in the description.
        The student will usually want to know it after having read the
        description. The duration belongs to the end of the description. </li>
      <li>Delete the "Description" label. It's obvious and as such it belongs
        to the "noise" category: the reader has to process and discard it. Same
        with the "Profile" label. </li>
      <li>See <a href="#Alternate">alternate layout</a> at the end of this
        section. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The courses list needs a "Search" function. This is not needed right now,
    but will be a must as soon as the list grows. Al alternative would be
    tagging the courses, and allowing the user to filter by tag. </li>
</ul>

<p id="Alternate"><strong>Alternate layout</strong></p>

<p>Below is an attempt to show the same data, arranged in a more usable
fashion. </p>

<p>Most notably, the user can scan the course titles quickly, because they are
highlighted and set on top of the subordinate data. </p>

<p>Second in importance is the course description, while the ancilliary data is
grayed so the user can read it if she wants to, but these items are not at all
outstanding. </p>

<p>Floating the "Enroll" buttons to the far right moves then out of sight, but
available to be found at once when needed. </p>

<p>This data arrangement has the additional advantage of being ideal for
responsive layouts, as you can see by narrowing the viewport. </p>

<h4 id="L526">Following the Web UI Certification track</h4>

<p>For this part of the report I took the first course of the track, a
programming primer. During the course I took notes of the issues I found. </p>

<p>This is a subject I know in full and have taught in the past at university
level. As I know the subject, I was enabled to detect issues about the content
in addition to the UI issues. </p>

<p>The content issues are specific of this course, while the UI issues might be
applicable to other courses implemented with the same platform. </p>

<p>In general terns, the platform looks as if it was not fully baked, with a
plethora of tiny details to be fixed. Although each detail is a small issue by
itself, it is the sum of many small things what lowers the usability of a UI,
and this is the case. </p>

<p>As of the content, the course is made of a set of very well explained videos
presenting programming in a rather outdated fashion. Eack lecture, comprised of
several videos, contains a Powerpoint-type document that is not fully
integrated with the related videos, and its quality is not high. </p>

<p>Additionally, it seems that we don't have legal rights to use these videos.
The course has an additional section "Support information" that is of much
lower quality. </p>

<p>Every person has only one opportunity to start learning about programming in
their lives, and the quality of that experience will impact all their next
steps. IMO this course is not the kind of experience that will not make the
students love software development. </p>

<p>Developing a course for the purpose of priming totally non-programmers is a
huge effort. On the other hand, such effort was already untertaken by a lot of
others. </p>

<p>I strongly suggest that we focus on new turf, and instead of running a
homebrew course for a few hundred globers we think big and massively exhibit
our real power. </p>

<p>If we could leverage other people's courses we could focus in Globant's
reals strengths. The fact that in Globant there are many people who are great
programmers doesn't mean that we have the required expertise. Introductory
courses are most sensitive to the instructor's didactical abilities, which many
(not to say most) hardcore geeks completely lack. </p>

<p>A quick search, only in the coursera archives, returned a course named "<a
href="https://www.coursera.org/course/programming1">Learn to Program: The
Fundamentals</a>" which is currently finished but open and I plan to evaluate
because it can show interesting statistics: </p>
<pre># users registered at close of course: 66,510
# users who watched the first video:   48,520
# users who watched the last video:    10,935
# users who submitted the final exam:   8,600
# Statements of Accomplishment:         7,839 (11%)</pre>

<p>This is a very good record for a MOOC. </p>

<p>The course <a
href="http://coursetalk.org/coursera/learn-to-program-the-fundamentals">has 141
reviews</a> which might be useful for our purpose, with an average rating of
4.6 stars out of 5. It links to other similar courses: </p>

<h5 id="L464">Track: Web UI Certification / Level 1 - Track 1 - Introduction to
Computer Programming</h5>

<p>Turns out that instead of one single course we could offer the globers a
wider choice so they can take the course that fits them better. </p>

<p><strong>Content comments</strong></p>

<p>The course is based in a set of lynda.com videos, published in youTube, that
are somehow outdated both regarding the content and also the approach. </p>
<ol>
  <li>This track, "Introduction to Programming", instead of being an integral
    part of the Web UI course should be a separate course by itself, bacause
    it's also basic in other courses. Instead of being a part it should be a
    prerequisite. </li>
  <li>The lynda.com videos in Lecture 1 contain a lot of ancilliary information
    that the student doesn't need yet, like the differences between compiled or
    interpreted languages, or information about machine code. 
    <p>IMO having to process all this information up front, in the first 15
    minutes, poses an arid landscape to the student who is eager to see some
    real code once and for all. </p>
    <p>IMO it should start with something like the content of the video in
    Syntax &rarr; Lecture 1 &rarr; Video 2</p>
  </li>
  <li>There is an item in the left hand index labeled "Introduction to
    Programming La" which is clearly wrong. It seems as if it was truncated,
    but the complete last word (presumes "Languages") is never shown. Also,
    this course is not an introduction to <em>programming languages</em>, but
    to <em>programming</em>. </li>
  <li>The slides in Lecture 1 have the same problem. I'd save the historical
    background for an upcoming class. </li>
  <li>Slide 18 in Lecture 1 is misleading. </li>
  <li>Slide 28 is a circular definition of OOP, smartes students will ignore
    it. </li>
  <li>Slide 34, about OOP inheritance, introduces a bad practice which is using
    pluralized names for classes. Plural names are for collections. </li>
  <li>Slide 39, about identifiers, is a bad explanation. Firstly, identifiers
    shouldn't be defined as "the names of objects" disregarding the fact that
    the word "object" has a special meaning in this context. Secondly, the
    "symbolically" term used is the right way to define this but it's used
    before being presented. And finally, there is no mention to function names
    as identifiers. </li>
  <li>In slide 45 "Structured Programming" is mentioned but was never defined
    (and will never be, I guess for now). </li>
  <li>Slide 47, about passing parameters by value, mentions the parameter
    concept which is not yet defined. </li>
  <li>Many other slides display conflictive content. IMO exposing the students
    who have no idea about programming to this material might harm them in an
    irreversible way. </li>
  <li>Syntax &rarr; Lecture 1 &rarr; Video 1, is severely outdated about the
    usages of the JavaScript language. </li>
  <li>Syntax &rarr; Lecture 1 &rarr; Video 5 is very good in how it explains
    some concepts about numeric variables. </li>
  <li>Sometimes there is no correlation between the laft hand pane and the
    content pane, i.e., it's not possible to find out which of the elements of
    the index is displayed as content. In the example, the title at the left
    don't match the titles at the top of the right content pane. 
    <p><img alt="not possible to relate index and content" style="width:100%; "
    src="mooc/course-noLetfRightConnection.png"></p>
  </li>
  <li>The video at Classes &rarr; Functions &rarr; Lecture 1 &rarr; Video 4
    doesn't come up. </li>
  <li>IMO the word "Document" is too generic. Yes, it is a document. But
    designing it as "Document" is like to have a son and name him "Son". 
    <p>Suggestion: Instead of "Document" use the section names, like
    "Operators, If and Switch" or "Functions". </p>
  </li>
  <li>The content of the Globant branded "Document" of the "Functions" section
    is not carefully related to the content of the corresponding videos. </li>
  <li>The "Document" has links telling the student to watch the lecture videos.
    But, the videos are listed <em>before</em> de "Document" so the natural
    order would be to watch the videos and then open the "Document" that point
    to the same videos. 
    <p>Suggestion: If the "Document" has to be opened before in order to be led
    to the videos then set the link to the "Document" before the video linls.
    </p>
    <p>Also, if the videos are subordinate to the "Document" then the video
    links should also appear as subordinates of the appropriate "Document"
    link. </p>
  </li>
  <li>In Classes eee Iterations eee Lecture 1 eee Document eee Slide 16 the
    name of the video is wrong, repeated from the previous video. 
    <p>It should be "Creating a for loop". </p>
  </li>
  <li>Given that the videos have their own descriptive names, those names
    should be displayed in the left hand index, like "3 Creating a for loop".
    This is helpful for the students, for example in case they wanted to review
    a subject. With the current arrangement they must remember the correlation
    between video numbers and subjects, or open videos until they see one that
    has the right title. </li>
  <li>Each section should have a small assessment after if, for the students to
    know that they understood the basics or that they should review the
    subject. </li>
  <li>The lynda.com videos belong to lynda.com and one is supposed to pay for
    the right of using them. See <a
    href="https://www.google.com.ar/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDQQtwIwAQ&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lynda.com%2FJavaScript-tutorials%2FWorking-operators%2F81266%2F87525-4.html&amp;ei=qJbiUtT8OIePkAeup4HAAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEeXqS6lTGjoNFhdn3FYBSSPQzupw&amp;sig2=TKATzItvp016x0ZSoREuzQ&amp;bvm=bv.59930103,d.cWc">an
    example here</a>: as soon as I clicked "play" the site requested me to pay.
  </li>
  <li>In Support information &rarr; Lecture 1 &rarr; Video 1, the code examples
    are written in MEL and Python, while all the previous examples are written
    in JavaScript. IMO this is too bold for a forst contact with programming.
  </li>
  <li>The "Support Information" section videos are of much less quality than
    the previous ones. Also, these videos are focuse on startin programminf 4D
    models with Blender, which is a good thing, but IMO falls out of bounds in
    a course like this. </li>
  <li>The "Exam" is void. </li>
</ol>

<p></p>

<p><strong>UI &amp; interaction comments</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Videos have to open in the course window</li>
  <li>There must be a "next" button in each and every step</li>
  <li>Anyway, the hierarchy at the left panel has to highlight the currently
    selected item</li>
  <li>The hierarchy at the left somehow has to convey information about which
    items were already visited by the student 
    <p>Check the coursera videos listing below. The videos already seen have a
    checkmark. </p>

    <div class="framed">
    <img style="width:100%; max-width:639px;" alt="coursera videos listing"
    src="mooc/coursera-videoLectures.png"></div>
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>Clicking compound items in the left hand hierarchy should display their
    sub-hierarchy in the content pane. </li>
  <li>There should be a set of back and forward buttons, for the student to
    backtrack his progress. Alternatively, stack their movements in the
    browser's history. </li>
  <li>There are many "Lecture 1" sections. This difficults references in
    questions. </li>
  <li>Getting back to the course doesn't open it in the last lesson accesed,
    neither the system remembers the state of the left hand side artifact
    (should display as it was when the page last closed). </li>
  <li>The "Documents" are written in different colors, several colors per
    slide, that convey no apparent meaning. The software code is usually
    displayed in different colors to highlight the syntax, but this is not the
    case. Reading text like this is distracting, as the mind automatically
    attempts to decypher the meaning of each color. 
    <p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="random text colors"
    style="width:100%; max-width:566px; "
    src="mooc/course-randomColors.png"></p>
    <p>Suggestion: Do not use ramdon colors, stick to black or dark gray. </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h5 id="L892">Taking course: Web UI Certification / Level 1 - Track 2 - Web
Development</h5>
<ul>
  <li>The enrollment passes the user through the sign in form, which is
    implemented as a separate page. After signing in it takes the user back to
    the courses listing, but not in the same scroll position. This forces the
    user to search again for the course in irder to click its "Go to class"
    button. 
    <p>Suggestion: Replace the "Enroll" button by a "Go to course" that takes
    the user to a "course's home page" with details about the course (like a
    picture of the author, a related image or a screenshot) and put the
    "Enroll" button in that course homa page and do the whole enroll thing
    there, including abiding to the conduct code. Thus, if the action requires
    signin in the user would be taken back to the exact place where she was
    before. </p>
    <p>As a temporary quick fix, take the student directly to the course
    material at the end of the enrollment process. </p>
  </li>
  <li>The left-hand index starts with a root "Classes" item. This is pointless,
    because it's not functional and thus only adds noise. 
    <p>Suggestion: do not show the "Classes" item in the left-hand item. </p>
  </li>
  <li>The first element og the left-hand index is labeled "Program". This is
    not good English. 
    <p>Suggestion: Replace "Program" by "Syllabus". </p>
  </li>
  <li>The "Program" element is a 3-level structure thus: 
    <ul>
      <li>Classes 
        <ul>
          <li>Program 
            <ul>
              <li>Lecture 1 
                <ul>
                  <li>Video 1</li>
                  <li>Document-+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The only actionable item is "Document". There is no video, and this
    doesn't qualify as a lecture, thus such labeling is misleading. </p>
    <p>Suggestion: Link the "Document" to the first level and delete all the
    other non-functional levels. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Section "Web Development Core Concepts" 
    <ul>
      <li>The first videos give the student a historical review of the making
        of the Internet and social media. This, albeit interesting, is not
        essential knowledge for the developer to be, who might already know
        most of it. Also, this poses a semantic layer while the student is
        aiming at the underlaying technologies. 
        <p>Suggestion: Take these videos from the mainstream course and tag
        them as interesting optional material for the curious. </p>
      </li>
      <li>Video 5, about widgets, is a commercial from somewhere, that implies
        a lot of the knowledge this course is supposed to provide. 
        <p>Suggestion: Turn down this video. </p>
      </li>
      <li>Video 11 stops in error after a few minutes. Should be replaced by
        this other version of itself: <a
        href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDj983Ggjk8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDj983Ggjk8</a>.
      </li>
      <li>The whole "Web Development Core Concepts" lecture (11 videos) is not
        about web development, but web history, usage and trends. </li>
      <li>The "Document" link is void. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Section "HTML Structure, Layouts, CSS": 
    <ul>
      <li>There is no "HTL Structure" content, right from the first video the
        subject is CSS, and being that CSS is for HTML then HRML should have
        been presented before. </li>
      <li>The section starts with an enumeration of the different doctypes. The
        student learns that HTML 3.2 does not support frames and style sheets
        before being told what frames ans style sheets are. Additionally, for a
        student starting today, the simple HTML5 doctype would be enough, at
        least during quite a while. The doctype is the first line of the HTML
        document, but need not be the first concept tossed to the student. </li>
      <li>Video 2 stops in error at start. This seems the original one: <a
        href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awmx8XlgcaE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awmx8XlgcaE</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Video 2 is a CSS primer, about how to add style to HTML elements that
        haven't been introduced yet. Also, it's scope is too limited to be
        presented as <em>the</em> education source: it merely walks the user
        accross a few pointless color change examples. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Section "Support Information": 
    <ul>
      <li>There is a "Lecture 1" tied "Vdeo 1" and "Document", all empty. 
        <p>Suggestion: Delete empty sections. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Section "Evaluation": 
    <ul>
      <li>This section has visual design issues that make it look as a low
        quality production. The issues I see are: 
        <ul>
          <li>Lack of a visual hierrchy. All text is set with the same font
            size and weight. 
            <p>Suggestion: Highlight the exam title and the questions text.</p>
          </li>
          <li>In multiple choice questions, the buttons are set after their
            labels. This is not the usual arrangement, and makes it look
            untidy. Usually the buttons are set in a straight vertical column
            and their labels after the buttons. 
            <p>Suggestion: Set the buttons to the left of their corresponding
            labels. </p>
          </li>
          <li>Technical: The id="question" is used in many places (23) which
            makes this HTML invalid. </li>
          <li>The word "Question:" in each and every question is obvious and
            redundant. 
            <p>Suggestion: Delete "Question:" from each question. </p>
          </li>
          <li>The labels and theit corresponding buttons are not linked. This
            is both a usability and an accesibility issue. A lind user would be
            uncomfortable filling this form, the other users cannot choose an
            answer clicking its label, they are forced to click the (smaller)
            button. All modern forms link the labels and their inputs. See the
            <a href="#examComparison">comparison of the original exam vs. a
            modified version</a>. 
            <p>Suggestion: Link each label to its associated button. </p>
          </li>
          <li>In the first question the name "Mozilla" is mispelled. 
            <p>Suggestion: Add the missing "L". </p>
          </li>
          <li>The title "Exam Web Development" sounds strange in English. 
            <p>Suggestion: Switch to "Web Development Exam". </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
